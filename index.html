                        <ol>
                            <li>Book-Keeper for SER Enterprises</li>
                                <p>I worked as a book-keeper from March 2019 - March 2020. I was over entering in credit card charges, bank account reconciliation in quickbooks, and organizing vehicle and employee information into excel spreadsheets.</p>
                            <li>Accounts Payable Clerk for Lifetime Products</li>
                                <p>I worked as an A/P clerk from March 2020 - March 2021. While working this position I entered invoices, matched payment runs, communicated with vendors and customers relating to invoices and billing, created processes for work flows, and I was also over the training of anyone new that was hired.</p>
                            <li>Staff Accountant for Lifetime Products</li>
                                <p>I was promoted to a staff accountatnt in March of 2021 worked there until I moved away for school in April of 2022. During my time as a staff accountant I was on the GL team where I worked with a group of other accountants to help reconcile and close out GL accounts monthly, quarterly, and yearly. I was also incharge of tracking all the inventory accounts by doing regular audits and visiting stores to make sure our inventory was always as close to perfect as it could be.</p>

                    <h3>Characteristics/Skills</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strong Characteristics/Skills:</li>
                                <p>Detail oriented: While working at Lifetime Products, a billion-dollar company, I managed around $20 million worth of discounts a year. For the two years I worked there I hit my goal every week in discounts taken from the discounts offered, and I did this while overseeing many projects which required my detailed undivided attention day in and day out.</p>
                                <p>Visual Basic for Applications (VBA): After taking a semester at BYU I was introduced to VBA in excel and have since done many projects that deal with various different data. Since taking that class I have used it with Lifetime Products in their accounting department.</p>
                                <p>Adaptable: I feel that I personally thrive the most under situations that are subject to change, in fact I embrace change. I always beleive that somewhere, someway there is a more sufficient way to do a current project or task and during my time working at Lifetime Proucts I always looked for ways I could make things run better an more efficient.</p>
                            <li>Characteristic I am making better:</li>
                                <p>Public speaking: This was something that I have always struggled, because one of my weaknesses used to be stuttering and using filler words like “um” and “uh” often. After working at Lifetime Products for four months most of my co-workers retired or left for a different job. This presented me with the opportunity to be the most senior person in my department and required overseeing the training of everyone new. This opportunity gave me many chances to practice speaking in meeting, overseeing different projects/reports, as well as clearly creating and teaching processes to new employees.</p>
